What did you learn?
We learned how to pull information with API keys by using ajax calls. We learned how to brain storm together by coming up with ideas on how to build a useful application. Each of us helped to contribute all of our different ideas which brought a lot of creativity to our website. It was a great experience collaborating with our group members.


## Feautures
This web application consists of: 
 - Search Bar
 - Two drop down buttons for diet type and sorting

## Usage

[FoodFix Website](https://kev-luo.github.io/FoodFix/)

The main page contains a few simple search parameters. Only the food parameter is required, all other parameters have default values set so that the user has less to type. If no results are found, a modal pops up and informs the user. If the user does not specify a food, an error message shows up below the food search bar. Results are displayed below the search box, with each recipe containing some quick facts about the nutritional content, recipe popularity, and prep time. The user can click on any recipe they like, which directs them to the next page, which we go into more detail further on in this section.

This is the first API call utilized on the main page. The getRecipes function makes the call and then displays the relevant information based on the specified food and other optional parameters. Each recipe box is provided a data-recipeId attribute. Additionally, this function concatenates all returned recipe ID's to be utilized in the bulk recipe search API below.

This is the second API call utilized on the main page. Obtaining quick facts for multiple recipes required a different URL. The getQuickFacts function uses the concatenated recipe ID's provided by the getRecipes function to request information for all recipes ID's provided. This function then appends the quick facts to the appropriate recipe box based on each box's data-recipeId attribute.

The second page contains detailed information about the recipe that the user clicked on. This includes a list of ingredients, preparation instructions, the source URL for the recipe, and a chart showing in-depth nutritional content.

The getIngredients function makes an API call to return the list of ingredients, as well as the recipe instructions. This function displays the recipe instructions, and concatenates all ingredients into one string, which is needed as a parameter to make the API call that returns the pictures of all the ingredients.

The previewIngredientWidget function makes an API call to return Spoonacular's ingredient visualizer widget. This widget is displayed inside an iframe tag, which is dynamically resized depending on the size of the returned content.

The getNutrients function performs the final API call on this page. The response returns two separate arrays: the good nutrients and bad nutrients. Each of these arrays are displayed using Bulma's progress bar components.
